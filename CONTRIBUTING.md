# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this.

Come find me in [#dev] channel on ilita IRC network in to I2P.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pbotectl](https://github.com/polistern/pbotectl/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).   
Please follow conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits.   
One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

After a short discussion, one of the [coding styles](https://github.com/motine/cppstylelineup) will be determined, which better meets our requirements.

For now GNU style is used.

Sincerely yours,
polistern
