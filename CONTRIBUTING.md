# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pbotectl](https://github.com/PurpleBote/pbotectl/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Please follow [style convention](#style-conventions) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits.

One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

After a short discussion, one of the [coding styles](https://github.com/motine/cppstylelineup) will be determined, which better meets our requirements.

For now [GNU style](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html) is used.

If you have any questions about the code or styles, you can find me in `[#dev]` channel on **ilita** IRC network in to I2P.

Sincerely yours,  
*polistern*
